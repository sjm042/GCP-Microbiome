1. Scripts for statistics and plotting figures in our manuscript entitled "Bacteria and fungi synergistically reprogram 
   flavonoid metabolites in the pericarp of Citrus reticulata ‘Chachi’ during storage".
2. Some figures was generated by web-base sofeware and other commercialize sofeware. So, there is no code for there
  figures and only data set was upload.
4. If you need some help about these issues, please contact me any time (sjm042@163.com).
