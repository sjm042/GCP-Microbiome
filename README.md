1. Scripts for statistics and plotting figures in our manuscript entitled "Bacteria and fungi synergistically reprogram 
   flavonoid metabolites in the pericarp of Citrus reticulata ‘Chachi’ during storage".
2. Some figures were generated by web-base sofewares and other commercialize sofewares. So, there is no code for these
  figures and only data set were upload.
4. If you need some help about these issues, please contact me any time (sjm042@163.com).
